Hobby project to get familiar with Socket.io.

An example chat application with (almost) all the features listed on Socket.io getting started pages:
- [x] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
- [x] Add support for nicknames
- [x] Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
- [x] Add “{user} is typing” functionality
- [x] Show who’s online
- [ ] Add private messaging

Used technology stack:
Client:
jQuery, Socket.io, 

Server:
NodeJs
